This web-based application is designed to take a text file delimited by tabs and turn it into a normalized database. It uses a combination of PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a pleasant user experience for transforming the file into a relational database. As a point of reference, the textfile MUST be delimited by tabs and the first line of the file MUST contain the column names: purchaser name, item description, item price, purchase count, merchant address, and merchant name. This is important for a successful import.
